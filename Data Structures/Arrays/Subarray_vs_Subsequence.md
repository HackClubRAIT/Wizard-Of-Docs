# Subarrays Vs Subsequence

## Subarays

```
Subarrays are arrays within another array. 
It contains contiguous elements 
Example: Let's consider an array 
A = {1,2,3,4,5} 
Then the subarray of given array are {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {1,2}, 
{1,2,3}, {1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4,5}, {2,3}, {2,3,4}, {2,3,4,5}, {3,4}, 
{3,4,5}, {4,5}. 
Number of Subarray an array of 'n' element can have (excluding empty subarray) = (n*(n+1))/2 . 
```

### Program to print all non empty subarrays: 

```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>  
using namespace std; 

int main() { <br>
    int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}; 
    for (int i=0; i<5; i++) { 
        for (int j=i; j<5; j++) {  
            for (int k=i; k<=j; k++) {  
                cout<<arr[k]<<" ";  
            }
            cout<<endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
### Time Complexity and Space Complexity

```
Time Complexity: O(n^3)
where n is size of array and we have to run three for loops.

Space Complexity: O(1)
here we have to just print output without storing it.
```

## Subsequence

```
Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array.
Need not to be contiguous.
It contains zero or more elements without changing its order of other remaining elements.
Example: Let's consider an array 
A = {1,2,3,4,5}
Then the subsequence of given array are {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, 
{1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}, {1,4}, {2,4}, {1,2,4}, {3,4}, {1,3,4}, 
{2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4}, {1,5}, {2,5}, {1,2,5}, {3,5}, {1,3,5}, {2,3,5}, 
{1,2,3,5}, {4,5}, {1,4,5}, {2,4,5}, {1,2,4,5}, {3,4,5}, {1,3,4,5}, 
{2,3,4,5}, {1,2,3,4,5}.
Number of Subsequence an array of 'n' element can have (excluding empty subsequence) = (2^n - 1).
```

### Program to print all non empty subsequence:

```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
    int n = 5;
    int noOfSubseq = pow(2, n);  //to find no of non zero subsequence i.e. (2^n-1)
    for (int i=1; i<noOfSubseq; i++) {
        for(int j=0; j<n; j++) {
            // Check if jth bit in the i is set.
            // If set then print jth element from arr[].
            if (i & (1<<j)) {
                cout<<arr[j] <<" ";
            }
        }
        cout<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity and Space Complexity

```
Time Complexity: O(2^n)
time is exponential because we have to print all possible subsequence present in array.

Space Complexity: O(1)
here we have to just print output without storing it.
```

```
Every Subarray is a sub Subsequence, but every Subsequence is not a Subarray.
