# The Venerable 8-Queens
- This one is a classic in computer science. The goal is to assign eight queens to eight positions on an 8x8 chessboard so that no queen, according to the rules of 
  normal chess play, can attack any other queen on the board. 
- In pseudocode, our strategy will be:
```cpp
Start in the leftmost columm
IF all queens are placed, RETURN true
FOR (every possible choice among the rows in this column)
 IF the queen can be placed safely there,
    Make that choice and then recursively try to place the rest of the queens
    IF recursion successful, RETURN true
    IF !successful, remove queen and try another row in this column
IF all rows have been tried and nothing worked, RETURN false to trigger backtracking
```

 * Function: Solve
 * ---------------
 * This function is the main entry in solving the N queens problem. It takes
 * the partially filled board and the column we are trying to place queen in.
 * It will return a boolean value which indicates whether or not we found a
 * successful arrangement starting from this configuration.
 *
 * Base case: if there are no more queens to place, we have succeeded!
 *
 * Otherwise, we find a safe row in this column, place a queen at (row,col)
 * recursively call Solve starting at the next column using this new board
 * configuration. If that Solve call fails, we remove that queen from (row,col)
 * and try again with the next safe row within the column. If we have tried all
 * rows in this column and haven't found a solution, we return false from this
 * invocation, which will force backtracking from this unsolvable configuration.
 *
 * The starting call to Solve has an empty board and places a queen in col 0:
 * Solve(board, 0);
