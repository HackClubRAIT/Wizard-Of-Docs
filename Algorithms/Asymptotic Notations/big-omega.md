# ðŸ§­Big-Î©(Omega)
Big-Omega (Î©) notations are used to define the lower bound for the runtime taken by the algorithm. Sometimes, we define the least amount of time while not stating the maximum limit. Big-Î© comes in handy in such cases.
# 
### Definition-
<b>Big-Omega (â„¦)</b> notation gives a lower bound for a function _f(n)_.

We write _f(n) = â„¦(g(n))_, If there are positive constants *n<sub><sub>0</sub></sub>* and *c* such that, to the right of *n<sub><sub>0</sub></sub>*  the *f(n)* always lies on or above _c<b>.</b>g(n)_.

*â„¦(g(n)) = { f(n) : There exist positive constant c and n<sub><sub>0</sub></sub> such that 0 â‰¤ c g(n) â‰¤ _f(n)_, for all n â‰¤ n<sub><sub>0</sub></sub>}*

#
We say that the running time is "big-Î© of *f(n)***.**" We use the big-Î© notation for **asymptotic lower bounds** since it bounds the growth of the running time from below for large enough input sizes.
#
#### Note-
Just like Big-O, Big-Î© does not give a precise view about the time. That is we can say that the worst-case running time of binary search can be *Î©(1)*, but that might not be true for all cases.
