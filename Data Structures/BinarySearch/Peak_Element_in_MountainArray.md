## Problem Description

An array `arr` a **mountain** if the following properties hold:

- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
    - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
    - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given a mountain array `arr`, return the index `i` such that `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`.

You must solve it in `O(log(arr.length))` time complexity.

The Problems aks us to find out the Index of the element which has a decreasing/Increasing list of element on the left side from that element as well as Increasing / decreasing list of elements on its right side.

Basically If you imagine a Mountain 🗻, and elements to be trees we need to find the element on top of the mountain where the pattern of elements changes Below are few examples 👇🏽

**Example 1:**

```markdown
**Input**: arr = [0,1,0]
**Output**: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```markdown
**Input**: arr = [0,2,1,0]
**Output**: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```markdown
**Input**: arr = [0,5,10,2]
**Output**: 2
```

## Solution

## With Java

By using basic Principle of binary Search and making small adjustment for this question we can solve the question.

```java
public class Mountain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
				int[] array = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 30, 20, 10};
				int result  = peakIndexInMountainArray(array);
				System.out.println(result);
					
    }
// here we mentioned the method to be static, because if the method is static we can access that method without an object(i.e , we can access the method directly with its name).

    public static int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] > arr[mid+1]) {
                // you are in dec part of array
                // this may be the ans, but look at left
                // this is why end != mid - 1
                end = mid;
            } else {
                // you are in asc part of array
                start = mid + 1; // because we know that mid+1 element > mid element
            }
        }
        // in the end, start == end and pointing to the largest number because of the 2 checks above
        // start and end are always trying to find max element in the above 2 checks
        // hence, when they are pointing to just one element, that is the max one because that is what the checks say
        // more elaboration: at every point of time for start and end, they have the best possible answer till that time
        // and if we are saying that only one item is remaining, hence cuz of above line that is the best possible ans
        return start; // or return end as both are =
    }
}
```
## With Python
```python

def Peak_Index_In_Mountainarray(arr):
    start = 0
    end = len(arr)-1
    while(start<end):
        mid = int(start+(end-start)/2)
        if(arr[mid] > arr[mid+1]):
								# you are in dec part of array
                # this may be the ans, but look at left
                # this is why end != mid - 1
            end = mid
        else:
						# you are in asc part of array
            start = mid+1   # because we know that mid+1 element > mid element
				# in the end, start == end and pointing to the largest number because of the 2 checks above
				# start and end are always trying to find max element in the above 2 checks
				# hence, when they are pointing to just one element, that is the max one because that is what the checks say
				#	more elaboration: at every point of time for start and end, they have the best possible answer till that time
				# and if we are saying that only one item is remaining, hence cuz of above line that is the best possible ans
    return start  # or return end as both are same
 
array = [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 30, 20, 10]  # just a array of random Integers
result = Peak_Index_In_Mountainarray(array)  # calling out the funtion and storing value 
print(result)
